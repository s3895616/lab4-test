# lab4-test
This repo will utilise automated testing.
So the lab asked me to make some changes to the README.md file, so here I am.
Something about the human condition. The meaning of life. Gregor Samsa as a big beetle.
Or is it?
Or am I typing random philosophical drivel to make this README.md seem smart?
We will never know.
